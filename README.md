## Introduction
**The WRO 2023 is an internationally recognized Olympiad competition that seeks to identify and showcase the exceptional talents in engineering and robotics. Participants from around the world come together to compete in a series of challenges designed to test their problem-solving abilities, technical expertise, and teamwork. The competition provides a platform for young minds to demonstrate their skills in designing and building robots while fostering innovation, creativity, and collaboration. It encourages participants to think outside the box and push the boundaries of what is possible in the field of robotics. By participating in the WRO 2023 competition, contestants have the opportunity to gain invaluable experience, form lifelong connections, and pave the way for a promising future in engineering and robotics. All while gaining engineering and learning skills: problem solving  and critical thinking skills that will imrpove the preformace ##

  ## How The Robot Was Made
  -Firstly we began with the servo motor and connected it to the wheel additionally we used the front body that contains the wheels, then we added the base servo motor after that we combined the parts together to make the body of the robot which will hold the battery and all the other components.We also added the DC Base MOTOR, connected the wheels, add the ULTRASONIC SENSORS(3X) last we made the camera stand which is adjustable and stablized the battery. And the Robot is ready for the code to be uploaded to start working.

   
# Hardware 
The physical parts of the robot that control the robot include:
* Ultrasonic Sensor x3
* ServoMotor
* Arduino Mega
* DC MOTOR
* MOTOR DRIVER
* DC Power Supply(12V)
* HUSKYLENS CAMERA

## Future Improvements and Tweaks
We've had a long journey, and we thought of many ideas and changes to the robot but we have came to a conclusion that we have to make the robot work 100% of the time with accurate and presice movements and after discussion here are some tweaks that we could do in the future:
*Changing the sensors
*working on the robot design
*working on the wiring system(rather than it being a mess)
  

### Software and Programming To develop our robot's software, we used the following: - Arduino IDE - C/C++ Programming Language
